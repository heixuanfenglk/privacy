    <h1>Privacy Policy for SOS Flashlight App</h1>
    <p>Last updated: [Insert actual date]</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The SOS Flashlight App is designed to provide users with a simple flashlight and SOS signaling tool using their device's built-in flash.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our SOS Flashlight app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data. The app only uses the device's flashlight functionality.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our app requires the following permission to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Camera permission: This is used solely to access the device's flashlight feature. We do not use the camera to capture photos, videos, or any other data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Data Storage and Transfer</h2>
    <p>As our app does not collect any user data, we do not store or transfer any personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store any user data, there are no data security risks associated with our app.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not use any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>8. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect any personal data, there is no user data to access, modify, or delete. Users can stop all data collection (although none occurs in our app) by uninstalling the application.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
